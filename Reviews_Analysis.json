While the reviewer enjoys the venue's ambiance and considers it a \"super fun spot,\" they clearly indicate that the food quality doesn't match the atmosphere. The emphasis that \"this place is more about the vibes than the food\" suggests that people should come for the atmosphere rather than the culinary experience.

        "Analysis":"Reasoning: While there are some positive comments about certain food items and presentation, the reviewer expresses disappointment with key items (pancakes), pricing, and ambiance.

Category-wise Sentiment:",
        "Analysis":"Despite the recovery efforts by the manager and hostess, the reviewer explicitly states they would not return. The initial negative experience with the doorman and welcome team, combined with the long wait time, appears to have overshadowed the subsequent attempts to improve the situation. The review demonstrates a clear case of poor initial service experience that, despite recovery efforts, resulted in a lost customer."
