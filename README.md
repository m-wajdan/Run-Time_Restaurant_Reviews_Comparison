# Run-Time_Restaurant_Reviews_Comparison

Using the concpets of WebScrapping, we worked on building a python web app.
Scrapped reviews of customers from a selected website.
Extracted different things using prompt enginnering and used LLM+API for this
Then once the app is final it ask user to enter the url of the website from a selected list of websites and then scrappes the reviews from there and then compare it with the one we selected initially
