Katie,Cool setup and views. The service was terrible and bland. They forgot to put in my food so my order finally came out when everyone was done. They were not busy.,3,3,1,5,Dined 4 days ago
Mark,"The  Christmas decor is not what it used to be nor what is advertised on the website.  Ordered the boozy hot chocolate and it was delivered at same time as the bill and was cold.  The food was also cold and average at best.  Overall, what used to be a great brunch has turned into a really poor experience.",1,3,2,1,Dined 4 days ago
Alisha,Had a reservation and was seated promptly. Service wasn’t great- slow and did not return many times to check in. Forgot one of the items we ordered. Food was average for the value. Would only come here for drinks in the future. Ambiance was cool,3,3,2,5,Dined 4 days ago

However, today…the pancakes are no longer pink, there were no decorations (not even for Christmas), they had most of the dining rooms shut off, and our waitress maybe came to our table twice. So unfortunate. And pastry basket was hard and dry,",2,2,2,2,"Dined on December 1, 2024"

Maria,"Went here for my birthday. Called the night before and asked about the indoor and outdoor of the rooftop, they said both were open and seating would depend on availability, they also said there is a DJ. We got there, they sat us in a dark corner behind the bar, the dj was on the other side of the whole rooftop and the music was very distant. We were 5 people and got squished in a corner table meant for 3-4 people. When we expressed that we werent happy with our seats due to the comfort, ambiance, and the fact that we were so far from everyone else to the hostess, she said theres nothing she can do except bring us an extra little LED candle for the table. We pointed to seats that were empty that we would be much happier with and she said they were all reserved (I had a reservation as well and was told you cannot reserve where exactly you would like to sit) The hostess was not helpful or friendly, the server was not attentive and we were overall very unhappy. We ordered 1 drink and booked skylark rooftop 5 mins away while we were there and just left. Looks nothing like pictures, extremely underwhelming, save your time go somewhere else.",1,2,1,2,"Dined on November 28, 2024"

Last night we showed up, there was zero decor, the bar was dark and so loud we couldn't hear each other, and we decided to leave before ordering.  I had seen gorgeous ads for Magic Rooftop a few years ago that matched our experience then, and I expected the same this time.  It looked like an entirely different place, just like any bar you could walk into off the street.  Disappointed.",2,2,2,2,"Dined on November 14, 2024"

Everyone from the woman who checked us in outside the building, to the people we met when we got off the elevator. The bartenders were cool and answered our questions as first timers, with the 2 hour bar pass, and our waitress (I believe was Melody), was great (and her curls were poppin'!).

We had a low bar set for food, and even planned where we could grab food after, but the food didn't disappoint and was really good and fulfilling.

The waitress was extremely nice and came by often. Ordered drinks and food at the same time but food hit the table first.  Ordered the suggestions of some of the signature drinks and specialty drinks. They were ok but we were there to have fun and we def did. The place is gorgeous.

jacqueline,We came here for brunch for my daughter’s birthday. The service was good in terms if checking in and short wait times. The food was terrible. We had the pancakes and the taste was bland. The cotton candy on top tasted like cough medicine. The pancakes are really big and the waiters provide really small plates. We ordered sides such as bacon and home fries and the portions were very small. The chicken tenders seemed like they came from a frozen package that you buy at a supermarket. There’s lots of picture opportunities so if you want “instagrammable” pics for over priced bland food then this is the place for you. I will not be returning.,2,1,3,4,"Dined on September 8, 2024"

I booked this place for a birthday celebration, and we agreed multiple times via email that they would accept the cake delivery. In fact, they even offered to buy the cake elsewhere and have it delivered to their premises. However, when the delivery driver arrived, they refused to accept the cake.

After some effort, I finally convinced them to take it, but when I arrived at the venue, they never served the cake as agreed. I waited for a long time, and the staff had no idea what I was talking about.

I said “ok, no problem, I’m going to just have the round of drinks that we selected and then you can bring me the check”. I was then told “but I already put the appetizers in, and how do you want to handle that?” She then told me that they needed to hold my card for the tab. The drinks were terrible, the shrimp tacos were okay. That was my first and last time going to Magic hour. There was nothing magical about it.

The tables are round and awkward, making group interaction difficult. The service was subpar. Once we ordered our first round of drinks we kept having to flag them down because they never checked in. The price of the food was outrageous considering it was a step above fast food. I’m a native NYer so I expect that in midtown Manhattan.

OpenTable Diner,"This place was soo awful for several reasons. To start, we didn’t feel welcome at all. This place is like a jail they’ll have you walk through all these dark halls and if you walk the wrong way they’ll yell at you even though the place is empty. As soon as I walked in the bag check lady immediately yelled at me to check my bag in. She had a god awful attitude from miles away I didn’t even trust my bag with her she seemed very off and miserable. Then after 10 mins of waiting for the elevator and being redirected and yelled at we finally catch the elevator upstairs. You’d think it would get better right? Absolutely not. There was no hostess whatsoever up there to seat us. We asked 3 different workers where the hostess was and they all guided us different places and ironically none had a hostess to be found. Why treat us like prisioners, make us check in our bags, follow specific directions how to get through the tiny building to make it seem mysterious. The place was so empty there was no reason for us to get treated like that. Terrible terrible terrible place we immediately left. NEVER come here if you want to get treated like you’re back in preschool. Would love to sit down with the manager and question why the hell he hired half the people there. So rude never coming back. We immediately went to 230 rooftop and it was sooo much better. Magic hour was just such a bad vibe it’ll put you in a bad mood because everyone there is so cranky and wants to have the one up over you even though the place is empty and garbage. Bad place if a hostess can’t even sit you and they’re no where to be found… got so tired of waiting and being mislead by workers we left",1,1,1,1,"Dined on July 7, 2024"

OpenTable Diner,"TLDR: the worst service I have had anywhere in the world. Overpriced. Can’t really see anything anyway.    . 
Awful service from staff throughout, starting with the rude hosts on the street: “Name!” “Bag!”. Rudeness continued by elevator host who couldn’t even manage to look at you while barking orders at you. This attitude was not just to us, but also to other guests who had arrived at the same time as us. Upstairs the host doesn’t welcome you on arrival and you’re stood waiting unsure where to go. Then they’ll arrive and again just say ‘name!’. I genuinely thought about not even sitting down and ordering but the upstairs host was a bit cheerier than downstairs and felt optimistic. For those from the UK like myself: $70 for the equivalent of echo falls. Food was mediocre and tacos were cold. No staff around to mention this to once you have ordered as they tend to stay clear of you when you’ve ordered. I really wouldn’t bother with this location! You can barely see anything from the rooftop anyway which is really why you want to go. Just not worth it!! 0/10",1,1,1,1,"Dined on June 10, 2024"

She then went to ask someone else who asked someone else. 30 minutes later they come back and tell me there's a table and she's going to wipe it down. Another 15 minutes go by and no one is back to update me while mind you the waitress told us not to order yet. so we couldn't even eat while we waited.

Shwin,"Really neat place with a great view.  Drinks were well made.  DJ was very good and energetic.  Ambiance is what will bring us back.  However, service was sketchy though, the ""hostess"" stand is not apparent and the restaurant is split into two sides so you're left wandering from side to side trying to figure out where the hostess stand is to check in.  We didn't know where to check in after wandering around for over 5 minutes with staff on both sides of the restaurant telling us to go to to the unmarked hostess stand in the connecting hallway that looked like a random table against the window.  Eventually we walked past a woman with her head down in her cell phone walking through the crowd who happened to overhear us say we didn't know where to go.  She was the hostess, not at the hostess stand for the entire duration we walked around the bar.  She had no name badge or uniform, she looked like another other patron.  We had two rounds of drinks and an order of food, sitting with empty drinks before the server came back to take our order and then it took over 20 min to get our bill and watched as party after party did the same wandering around the restaurant trying to figure out where was the hostess and a party next to us ended up walking out because the server never came.",4,2,1,5,"Dined on June 2, 2024"
Erica,"The aesthetic is very cute and picturesque, perfect for a catch-up with my girls. However, on a hot summer day, I just want good food and cold water. We had to ask our waiter multiple times for water, which should be the first thing they bring out without us having to ask. She brought my friend's alcoholic beverage before our water.

The food came out very quickly, but it was average. We had the crispy chicken sandwich, which needed more seasoning in my opinion. The fries were great. We also had to ask for utensils with our food. Once we finished eating and continued to catch up, our waiter asked multiple times if we were okay, even though we no longer needed anything but was hard to catch when we needed things. 

Minor improvements to customer service could enhance the experience. NYC restaurants often focus on aesthetics over customer service, and this place should work on that.",3,3,2,4,"Dined on June 2, 2024"

We ordered REGULAR FRIES they came on a white cone shaped container she charged us for TRUFFLE FRIES and I asked her specifically if it was a price difference and she said no they were the same price and I knew she was lying because why would house fries be the same as fries with Parmesan cheese and truffle oil?! Then I asked for a Berry bubbly but without the Tito’s vodka and she said the drinks are pre made so I said so what you are saying is it’s 2:00pm and if you run out of this drink it will not be anymore bottles of Victorious pink sparkling rose’ or raspberry Liqueur opened until Sunday to make another batch?! That’s how The Moxy do things because that’s not how Philly do things?! I’m from Philadelphia and if I want a drink made a certain way a REAL MIXOLOGIST can simply add or SUBTRACT the ingredient! So thanks for the pictures but I will certainly not be returning again! The Moxy was definitely overRATED! I gave her a tip not because she deserved it BUT because it’s the right thing to do! The food was just ok! The vibe is beautiful but the waitress with the curly hair(black girl)was awful! She needs and attitude adjustment! Also if that is true that drinks are pre made y’all need to change that…that is nasty it still would not justify me having a drink being made the way I want if I’m paying the price!,2,3,1,5,"Dined on June 1, 2024"

The food was NOT good an overpriced for no reason. I had the salmon Cesar salad and my salmon was under cooked pink and raw inside, no seasoning and zero taste.  I couldn’t even finish it. The manager did take one of the salads off our bill and sent us some “free fries” to try to compensate for the terrible food. It was hot and muggy and their ACs really didn’t make much of a difference. The seating is also unleveled as if you’re sitting on the couch and the person sitting across from you is sitting on a chair, you’re literally looking “up” at the person you’re dining with smh! The hostess at the ground level entrance was anything but inviting as she seemed to have an attitude and there was no hostess at the front upstairs upon our arrival leaving customers to try to figure out if they should go right or left to find their table.

CynthiaM,"I recently dined at magic hour rooftop , and unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. Despite the high expectations set by its online presence and glowing reviews, the ambience of the restaurant was a significant letdown.

From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere felt chaotic and poorly managed. The lighting was harsh and uninviting, more akin to a fast-food joint than a supposedly upscale establishment. The seating arrangement was cramped, and I found myself constantly bumping elbows with the diners at the next table, making for a very uncomfortable dining experience.

To add to the discomfort, the décor was outdated and mismatched, failing to provide the elegant and sophisticated atmosphere one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. It seemed like no real thought or care was put into creating an enjoyable dining environment.

Overall, while the food might have potential, the poor ambience overshadowed everything else, making it impossible to enjoy the meal. I would not recommend if you’re looking for a pleasant dining experience. There are far better options available that provide both great food and a welcoming atmosphere.",1,1,4,1,"Dined on May 19, 2024"

I booked this bar for happy hour in order to celebrate my daughter’s birthday with a few of her friends. 8 minutes after happy hour ended, and 2+ rounds in, I was informed by the server that happy hour “is only at the bar”. We were sitting 6 feet away at a bar table. I saw the happy hour heavily promoted with great prices for drinks and apps and booked this bar only based on this promotion. I was never told there was a restriction when seated or served. We all work in the hospitality industry and were shocked.

In addition to the fraudulent bait and switch it was a disappointing experience for other reasons. The service was incredibly slow and unprofessional(with the only exception being the very courteous hostess). We had to stand up and walk to the bar several times where outlets waitress was just chatting me with friends instead of serving tables. The quality of the drinks was also not great. We had to send the Negroni back as it came out pink and unrecognizable as a Negroni. The food was low quality for the price- no garnishes or care in plating, a surprise cake was set on the table with no instruction as to how to access the cake. We thought it was plastic. We were given no utensils. And finally had to ask what to do with the box. Server returned with a fork and knife and walked away to leave us wondering how to break open the surprise…

Extremely disappointing experience all the way around. I sent an email to management and have gotten no response. It was over $600 for 3 rounds of drinks and a few appetizers. It felt like we were sold one thing and charged for another. I will not go back and encourage others to avoid at all costs!!",1,1,1,2,"Dined on May 1, 2024"

OpenTable Diner,When we got there and was seated the floors where cracked and every time someone passed by us our table and seats would move . The drinks were good but the food was bad I ordered tenders that were frozen on the inside and tasted very odd . My partners food was also cold and the chicken sandwich was not cooked enough inside .

OpenTable Diner,The aesthetic of the Magic Hour is amazing and our server was pretty good also. The only issue I have is the drink/cost value. We paid for the “left the group chat” shot flight and I will say after about 4 shots between me and my friends we didn’t even feel as if we were drinking at all. Very sweet drinks and felt as if there was no alcohol at all in them. Food was ok.,2,3,4,5,"Dined on April 21, 2024"

OpenTable Diner,"To begin, we stayed at the Moxy Hotel yet had to walk outside in the pouring rain to walk through an outside door when the elevator inside the hotel went straight to the restaurant. The greeter was so confused by a large group that I think she put wristbands on everyone who continued to enter the building until I stepped in and let her know we had a reservation. Then, she didn’t give us wristbands, said we didn’t need them, which became a problem once we went upstairs. Anyone and everyone we encountered at the Rooftop Bar was disorganized and/or rude. Our table was broken and it took a few uncomfortable requests for them to seat us at one of their other *many empty tables. The QR code didn’t work on my phone or my tech savvy daughter’s. Acting completely put out, they brought us a paper version of the dinner menu instead of one for brunch. (I would have left at this point, or sooner, but my teenage daughter was very much looking forward to this pink experience for her birthday.) We pieced together ideas for our order (since no one could find a menu for us). My daughter watched as servers brought pink pancakes with giant sparklers on top. We ordered the pancakes, pink donuts, and a side of bacon. When the pancakes were brought over, I asked why a sparkler wasn’t included on ours. She incredulously asked, “You want to put it on now?” I replied that we would since it was my daughter’s birthday. (My daughter was looking defeated at this point.) Seeing how long and befuddled everyone who worked there seemed during the ordering process, I asked for the check and explained that we had a show we wanted to catch so it would be easiest to have the freedom to leave as soon as we had finished. The server could not understand why we wanted the check so soon. The food was tasty, looked amazing, as did the restaurant, but it didn’t even matter at that point. The experience was an overpriced nightmare and this restaurant is one that I would NEVER recommend to anyone else.",1,4,1,3,"Dined on March 23, 2024"

OpenTable Diner,"Very cute brunch spot with lots of photo opportunities. I know the brunch is open to all age groups but there were groups of children running around the carousel and screaming as if they were at the playground and not a restaurant/lounge. This was not addressed and definitely took away from the enjoyment of the experience as we really just wanted to have a nice brunch experience and not feel like it was the middle of recess at a daycare center.

MassielM,Let’s start with the location. It’s absolutely stunning. Perfect for capturing beautiful pictures. This location is great for birthdays or bridal events. Now why I didn’t give it 5 stars? The service was absolutely horrible. We kept trying to get things and waited an hour for a glass of water. We got our food and one of friends waited half an hour for her fries. It came once she finished her entree. The food was mediocre but that is most expected when places look that good. Menu was very small and that’s fine if the food was good. The only thing I liked was my salad. Everyone else’s food was not good. A tip would be to improve the quality of the service at least and then working on the food. The best part was the photos!,3,2,1,5,"Dined on March 10, 2024"

OpenTable Diner,"There’s 2 areas for brunch. One is more of a lounge area and to eat food is not the best. We asked the hostess to sit us on side (right from hostess stand) where the carousel was and she told us she couldn’t. My party and I personally felt they put the minorities on the left/lounge side and the white folks on the restaurant side. I say this because after asking to be seated on the right. They told us no availability and they sat a group of white people who did not have reservations that was waiting behind us. Our waitress Maria seemed to be occupied. She never checked on us to see if we liked our food or if we needed refills on our mimosa’s. The food was yummy I had to toast, my friends has the breakfast platter with potatoes, bacon and then the sandwich. Which was super yummy. Not a big food selection if you aren’t with a group the “pink” food is a little overwhelming for a group of 4. So we did not try any of the pink brunch food.",2,3,1,5,"Dined on March 3, 2024"

maria,"When we made the reservation, some very relevant points were not specified on the website. On the reservation website, each person would be entitled to 1 drink, however, when we got there we had no choice, the only option was a hot drink which we certainly wouldn't choose. The same thing happened with dessert, we couldn't choose. The dessert was cake, which wouldn't be our choice either as neither my boyfriend nor I really like cake. the main course was good but I didn't think it was anything special considering the price of the dinner. conclusion: horrible experience, we left there and went to another restaurant, we ate and drank much better for the same price. They should make it clearer on the booking website that the customer has no choice. I've never paid so much for such a bad experience, I wouldn't go back even for free.",1,1,2,4,"Dined on February 15, 2024"

CinV,"I was very underwhelmed with our experience. We brought the Galentines day experience package (the most expensive one). I noticed that the host kept asking if ppl had reservations which we did. I noticed that everyone with reservations were going to the entrance on the right, and for some reason I went to the left, which was less decorated, and everyone was more casual, which I felt overdressed. I did however, ask my server if we were able to switch sides because we did buy a package and we were here for the experience. She was lovely and let her manager know that we wanted to be seated in the other area which they were very nice and accommodated. We proceeded to tell our new server that we had a package we showed her on our phone and she went on to say that she had to check for herself which she came back and confirmed that we did indeed have a package. We asked her what it included, which she proceeded to tell us. Our drink that was included was basically champagne with a little cotton candy which was selling for $25 which was insane. We had a small plate which I got the truffle grilled cheese, tasted OK which came with the tomato soup now this is where I had the issue the menu said that it came with gruyere cheese but my cheese was yellow and gruyere cheese is white. The manager proceeded to tell me they mix cheddar and Swiss to MAKE gruyere cheese. Which should of been stated on the menu they weren’t actually using gruyere cheese which is why I wanted it and let’s not get started on the stab cake which was 90% frosting (which tasted grossed). When we did get to the cake it was ok. The experience definitely wasn’t worth the $95pp we paid. Which included tax and gratitude before the service which is possible why the service wasn’t above and beyond. Wouldn’t do another experience there again. And if you’re gonna have an experience for a certain holiday, you should up your dress code.

Although it was her responsibility. The restaurant restricted her for even going to look for it. Like we didn’t just spend money with them the night before. That left a bad taste in my mouth.

RIdiner,"We went to have brunch for 2 to celebrate a birthday.   Theme was Pink AF brunch and it definitely brought the pink!  Pink decor, pink themed mini carousel, pink alcohol and non-alcohol drinks, and pink brunch items.  There was a regular brunch menu and a a menu with special pink brunch items.  The pink brunch items were over the top, including 2 of the most over the top items, in my opinion:  a super huge stack of extra large pink pancakes with pink cotton candy on top and a massively huge pink croissant.  I think a table of 5 would struggle to clean the plates of these 2 items - it is that much food!  The atmosphere was cute (and pink) and we saw several other diners get into the pink spirit with pink outfits which was super fun to see.  We ordered just the pancakes and they were very good but did not finish as there was only 2 of us.  The pancakes come with sides and my companion really enjoyed the apples. I would say the other sides were fair.  It would have been great to have real maple syrup - maybe with sparkles added!  The pink mocktail we had was delicious and beautiful.  The sever was pleasant too.  Overall we had a very nice experience.  I would note that if you have gone to other Tao group owned venues, this one is not quite as excellent as some of their other restaurant experiences - but I recommend that you keep in mind that the Magic Hour is a rooftop bar, so expectations should be adjusted for fine  dining.  It was a very fun experience and recommend going for an experience that is out of the norm.",4,4,4,4,"Dined on January 14, 2024"

Multiple serves came to the table, no knowing that other had come; it seemed to me that they don’t communicate well.

LeanneT,"Upon arrival we were shown to our table which displayed a very limited brunch menu.  I asked the waitress of this was the extent of the food available and was told yes that was it.  I had booked this dining experience with my husband and 7 year old daughter.  As I had booked for brunch and given that I had asked the question about the menu, I did not question this further.  We were disappointed in the limited choice but went with it.  We ordered the sharing pancake stack which was priced at $50.  None if us really wanted this but this was the best of the options available.  When it arrived, it consisted of a giant stack of dry pink pancakes with candy floss on top.  There were three small dishes of fruit and syrup on the side.  Despite it looking presentable, the food was barely edible.  We managed to eat half of one pancake each.  We then noticed other people ordering other food which was not on our menu.  When we asked again, we were told that we should have been informed of the other menu accessible via a QR code.  We were past ordering anything else.  We reluctantly paid the $50 plus bill and left disappointed.  We had spent an amazing 6 days in NY having travelled on New Years day from the UK.  This was supposed to be our final experience before leaving for the airport.  Very disappointing.  Would very definitely not recommend.",1,1,1,2,"Dined on January 7, 2024"

Then on top of that I went to use the bathroom with my 2 yr old son then I returned from the bathroom. They threw all his food away, after he only had 1 bite of the chicken fingers. There was a whole order that I wanted to take home because I knew he would not finish it.

OpenTable Diner,This place isn’t really worth the hype (especially not for brunch) unless you’re seated at an actual table. If not they seat you at these lounge chairs where you’re basically hunched over trying to eat your steak and eggs. The drinks are good and music is good. I rated  the service low because when I asked if I could wait to be seated at the table (which I specifically reserved for in advanced) I was told they were none available as I watched people exit and enter the premises. They also took my number down and said they would call me and never did.  This place is 50/50. Go early! Or maybe don’t bother going at all unless they can confirm you can have a real table.

JamieG,"We arrived a few minutes after our reservation time, we were told our table was not ready and that we would be contacted once it was.  We went to wait at the bar as suggested.  While at the bar we could see there were quite a few tables where our party could fit comfortably, however we were not seated until after 50 minutes of waiting.  Note, we were never contacted via text regarding our table and had to ask the staff more than 3 times when our table would be ready.  At this point we were dealing with at least 3 different individuals, there seemed to be a lot of confused over a table when, as stated there were quite a few opened / available.

When we finally were seated 1 of the individuals said she was going to comp us for our 1st round of drinks.  When we ordered food, it took forever and people who were seated / ordered long after us received their food prior to us. The food was meh, DJ was all over the place having a great time by himself not tending to the crowd.  The service was an abomination, horrible, had to ask for napkins twice, never received utensils when our food came and when we asked for them, staff appeared confused on why we would need them???  I guess we were supposed to serve and eat with our hands, without napkins!   This was such a disaster Christmas office event that the Magic Hour staff ended up comping us for almost our entire bill.  So, in the end the sit down - food & drinks were a lower price than the initial drinks at the bar.

While we appreciate the staff comping us, the Magic Hour really needs to do better.  This is NYC if the atmosphere is what they want to focus on then they should get rid of the food and the rude, unskilled staff.  The seating staff and the waiters were literally going around like chickens with their heads cut off and rudely trying to rush us out at the end, taking our drinks before we even finished and preparing the table for the next guests.",2,2,1,2,"Dined on December 20, 2023"

MaryT,"We arrived for our 6:30pm reservations on time. They said they were getting tables ready and it would be 20-30min and we could wait in the bar. The bar was loud and we had no desire to sit in the bar so we waited by the hostess stand with another group of ladies. We specifically made the reservations to experience their Christmas themed dining room. After a bit the hostess came up to us and said follow me. She took us into the bar to a table that couldn't have been more than 2ft tall with built in sofas all around the room. It was defiantly not a dining table. We questioned her as to what this was and what were they trying to do. We had made dinner reservations a month in advance because that was when they opened Reservations for the specific day we were traveling. These were not last minute reservations.  She stated that the dining room had been reserved for a Private Party. This was not what we were told when we checked in. We told her that this was not what we made reservations for and left. Couple things...If they in fact rented the room out for a private party they should have called everyone who made a reservation to give them the choice to cancel. It felt like they just sold out for the higher price. We also felt profiled a bit. We are 2 Caucasian women who run businesses. We are not in our 20's or 30's. We were dressed nicely, smart casual is the dress code. We felt like because we didn't fit the look or age group that they want in their establishment we were pushed to the bar. Now I could be totally wrong but that was our perception.",1,1,1,1,"Dined on December 10, 2023"

OpenTable Diner,"Our initial server was trash. She saw us (we are black, but I'm not sure if that was the reason) and came by our table said we're serving brunch and attempted to leave without taking any order when I called her back. This was 15 minutes after we were seated, mind you she's been to her other tables and there's only an hour and a half window to eat and food takes time to be made. The food was subpar at best. The pancakes were really good and fluffy. The fried chicken was not great (please rate it for yourself, God bless in my Keith Lee voice) the carrot cake cupcake was not good and the regular breakfast was ok. Pink lemonade that comes with the Prosecco very tart, that is all, I hope this helps, photo ops are dope!!! Have fun!",3,1,3,5,"Dined on December 2, 2023"

Rhoda,"We booked this a month in advance for our daughter's 16th birthday based on the outside fall decorations, listed on the website as available ""through November."" We visited the restaurant on November 11 and noticed there was an ""adult"" theme but the pink fall decorations were abundant, and so the adult theme was not obvious or we would have cancelled that day. Upon arrival on Nov 25, all of the decorations wer removed, and only noticeably was the adult themed characters which were really offensive for a group of teenage girls. The table where girls were sat did not accommodate 10 people. In fact, maybe 6 could have sat at the table comfortably. I requested another table, but the only one available was a very low table in the lounge area which was unacceptable. My daughter cried. We traveled 2 hours by train to have brunch there and were extremely disappointed.  And you can never get your 16th birtday back. :(",1,1,1,1,"Dined on November 26, 2023"

Nishelle,"Terrible service and far too loud. I made this reservation with the understanding that it was a traditional sit down restaurant. Once I realized it’s more of a club atmosphere I let the hostess know and was going to leave but she suggested we try the “other side of the restaurant” which is a “more traditional sit down”. It was so so so loud. We had one server take our order, another run our food, another come fill our waters back up after they’d been empty for 10 minutes. We had to go to the bar where 4 servers were standing doing nothing to pay our bill. Nobody checked on us to see if we wanted more to drink, how our food was, if we wanted our bill, anything. If it is a bar, so be it, that’s fine. My issue is the lack of service after explaining to the hostess we were looking for a more traditional restaurant. All in all it was a very poor experience and I wouldn’t recommend it. We saw three other groups come in to eat and end up leaving after realizing what the vibe was. Maybe a clearer explanation on the website would’ve helped. Or, maybe just better service.",1,4,1,1,"Dined on November 22, 2023"

OpenTable Diner,"First of all, what is the point of a roof top bar if they cover it with another temporary roof? I’ve been here before and the views of the city and Empire State Building are amazing. But this time the entire “roof top” was covered with another roof. I get it’s cold out and people want to be warm but then don’t go to a rooftop bar. Or only put a temporary roof over half of the roof.

Besides that, we had a reservation and got sat very quickly but it took 25-30 minutes for our server to even acknowledge us and ask what we wanted. We ordered 2 drinks and they came out absolutely awful. Tasted like straight rubbing alcohol. We didn’t even finish the drinks. We paid and left. I don’t think I’d go back there again, at least in the fall/ wintertime when they have the “rooftop” bar covered. It’s just a regular bar at that point with awful drinks.",1,1,1,3,"Dined on November 19, 2023"

AnaZ,"The experience started off odd with the hostess very rudely asking 2 ladies that were patrons of the restaurant already to move from the spots we had reserved, even though there was plenty of room, and likely a better way to have handled the situation. We spent about 2 hours here, casually talking and continually ordering drinks and food. When we asked for the check, we saw one of my friends was overcharged by 2 drinks, and when I asked to review the order log, I saw this was done on purpose - the order we received drinks at didn't match up to when we ordered. I calmly explained this but the waitress did not relent and said she'd bring out a manager, which I welcomed. In the end, no manager came and one drink was removed. We ended up requesting the rest of the food we ordered to go and did not trust to eat it because even asking to have the food packaged up was met with disdain. The place has low reviews on Yelp for a reason - can't put make up on a pig. Shame because we were having a nice time up until we were targeted to get ripped off for no good reason. Avoid this place.",1,1,1,1,"Dined on November 3, 2023"

Mors,"We didnt have reservations but were able to grab a drink and make one on the spot via phone.

There were 2 sections, one was more for photo ops while the other was more of a party

Took a bit for the bartender to greet us but I believe it was because he was the only one there at the time and reinforcements were coming

When we were sat at the table to back cushion kept falling down and moving so wasnt too comfy but doable

The food was semi good. My boyfriend got the chicken sandwich with pumpkin pesto. Chicken was dry but he said the pesto helped. I got the barbocoa tacos and there was alot of meat on it and could have been made into 4-5 tacos rather than 2. Price was high but expected of a bar just feel like they should stretch the tacos and make the chicken moist or add fries.

The drinks were good the glasses they came in were unique and my boyfriend liked the pouring the drink over the ice mold cool. My last drink I asked the bartender to make something fruity and it was great hes really good at it!

Only gave 4 star because of the portioning/food and seating but with those fixed this would be a 5 star experience.",4,4,5,4,"Dined on September 14, 2023"

The bartender treated me like a child and ordered me to pay her bill that she wasn’t allowed to leave from behind the bar. I wasn’t aware I could t sit down and pay it. She made drinks but told me they were watered down because they sat too long. I couldn’t get up to the bar because of the crowd. It took her so very long to make the drinks to begin with.

The food: 100% NOT worth it. It’s an abbreviated menu with things that can be shared. The chicken box was over-battered and had a weird taste to it - didn’t eat any of it after one bite. Coconut shrimp were frozen shrimp (not fresh and jumbo) and were basic. Caesar salad was drowning in everything it came with - dressing was tasty, but overkill. Tacos were ok… and guacamole was average. 

I’ll definitely go back, but only for drinks. Will probably eat before or after… I’m a huge fan of trying new places and plates, but want my $$$ to be worth the spend. And sadly, for the food, it was not.",3,1,5,1,"Dined on September 4, 2023"

SERVICE: Waitress was not pleasant, She forgot our to-go containers and had an attitude when reminded. She also didn't return the credit card used to start our drink orders.

Instead of coming over to apologize for her error, she fumbled in the distance and sent the other waitress to our table, thankfully with the correct card.

Came over to the table to drop off the drinks and let us order once I spoke up about the time. Had to be combative over food at a restaurant. Make it make sense. I would understand if they closed early but no that wasn’t the case. Mind you made this reservation a month in advance and added a note on it being s special night. She Dropped the food off  and never returned. Had our orders wrong, and then charged us for food that was never delivered to our table. We had to grab our check from another server.

The ambiance was comfortable, and the menu offered a good variety of options. The food itself was enjoyable, with some standout dishes, but it didn’t quite make up for the lack of attentiveness in service.

MathewW,"We're staying in the Moxy so thought we'd give their rooftop bar a try. Big regret. It felt rude from the off, talk about ideas above their station, doorstaff were particularly agitated even at 6pm, this isn't some exclusive bar you are protecting at all costs. Bags have to go in a cloakroom, full metal detection before entry. This was night 1 of a 9 nine night stay at the Moxy and am now looking forward to giving the rooftop bar ZERO custom for the remainder of our stay. The hotel itself is awesome but this bar, not so much. I went to the restroom, as soon as I did my other half was told off by a security guard who appeared from nowhere, for taking photos of the cocktails - the irony is, her Canon DLSR camera is rubbish compared to the wannabe influencers taking photos on their iPhones. We were made to feel unwelcome and clearly not the right clientele despite paying £130 a night in the adjoining - awesome - hotel. Sort it out.

Those of us paying have to compete for time, on a 90 minute slot: to eat, socialize and take pics...yet we had to wait for people who took pics and never ordered anything and left. Plus those people using it were taking flowers. Not fair to paying customers who were not taking advantage.   We paid a lot to go here. Don't let people take advantage... its restaurant first and foremost.",4,5,4,4,"Dined on July 3, 2023"

KaylynB,"On July 2, 2023 my friend and I came here for the first time. All of the employees were friendly, attentive and efficient. We had a reservation booked and had no problems at all. The food and drinks were delicious. The presentation of the food and drinks were really nice. We ordered the cinnamon roll, grilled frites (skirt steak, french fries and vegetables), Caesar grilled chicken salad, Malibu beach bunny, Moira rose and a mojito. The host and waitress gave us ample amount of time at our table and even let us go over which we thought was so nice & considerate. The bill was reasonable and we generously tipped. The service is top tier. After eating and “getting nice” we moved on to take pictures. The set up was really nice and we didn’t have to wait long at all for our turn. We ordered more cinnamon rolls and drinks at the bar. We tried the diplomat and the berry bubbly. Those were strongggg! None of the drinks were watered down and that was a major plus. The bartenders were such a vibe! Additionally, the bathrooms were really clean and there was never a line to use it. The music selection was fire! The restaurant was lively and clean. The only downfalls  was that the tables are close together where others can be in your conversation and not much of a variety of dessert for brunch. Overall, the experience was amazing and I give it 5 stars out of 5! Thank you so much for making it memorable even though it was very humid and rainy. I wouldn’t shut up about it to my husband lol",5,5,5,5,"Dined on July 2, 2023"

RandallS,Saw this place on a list of the best rooftop bars in NYC. I can name 3 better ones right off the top of my head. This place feels like a tourist trap. Drinks were extremely watered-down. (I ordered whiskey and it clearly had been watered down.) Drinks were served in plastic cups. Service was disinterested and we were reminded at least twice that we only had the table for 90 minutes. That was not a problem. We were gone within 20 minutes. The bar within the Moxy hotel has the same menu and was much better. Avoid this place.,1,3,2,2,"Dined on June 29, 2023"

The menu allows you to select as little or as much as you want and to share many of the dishes. However we could’ve done with some guidance on the size of the portions as the special pancake stack was way too much for us two!
The food was imaginative and delicious but I felt the service could’ve been more attentive when compared to other restaurants.
It was a great location with an amazing view - particularly on a fine weather day and the roof screens are open. The music being played hit the right note!

I told the hostess that I would like to pay in cash and so she asked to hold my credit card just for internal procedures and ok, I gave her my credit card. When I asked for the bill, she just asked about the tips porcentage and give back my credit card. So, I asked the total value of bill and she told it was already paid by the credit card... Unbeliveable...
Also, we did not like any of the 6 drinks we asked for. Some with ""plastic taste"", I don't know how to explain exactly but defenitely we did not like it.
Oh, last but not least, when we arrive at Magic Rooftop's entrance, we show our reservation code which was printed in a A4 paper, the security guy starts to make fool of us, thinking that we would not understand it, but, unfortunately for him, we understood his jokes...

Underwhelmed,The pancakes were flat and flavorless on their own - cotton candy was the best part. Their value per dollar was way off and these should cost half. The drinks were good but not as spectacular as I was hoping. I suppose I need to come in the evening and order some of the more adventurous offerings. The decor was a straight zero. They must be in transition because 99% of the blooms were gone with the exception of one tiny corner and the bunny/barbie photo area in the rear. It is only fair to put an alert when making a reservation that the restaurant is in transition and not necessarily reflective of online photos. It was a major disappointment overall I'm sorry to say.

This rooftop is very small and nothing spectacular, the pink sculptures really need to cleaned or repainted. I wish they offered bigger plate options aside from finger foods. I order mocktails and they were delicious, however my group of friends & I had 3 different servers from the time we sat down. They rarely came around to check on us, which ultimately made us have to go the bar ourselves for drink. I had the worst experience at the bar. My friends and I had a reservation, when I went to the bar to order my drink the bartender had a nasty attitude (he barely spoke English), but we weren’t aware you had to open a tab at the bar, or pay for your drink immediately. I think that’s dumb as hell, why can’t you put it on the table tab? I wouldn’t have minded opening a bar tab, but his disgusting personality turned me off. I also don’t think a mocktail should be the same price as a regular cocktail. I’m paying for soda and grenadine!

Staff / hostess, doormen lack common courtesy. They almost seem as if your an inconvenience attending the restaurant as a paying customer. I get mean girl vibes specifically from the hostesses. They don’t look you in the eye while you speak to them and we’re in their phones. Upon greeting staff, they were totally dismissive. Also food is terrible/overpriced, small portions & is not good. Pub food from a small shop would be much better & worth your money. To further justify this review, we bumped into a group of girls having a birthday dinner asking for pictures. They also said they had the same experience and found all staff to be rude, dismissive and stuck up. We all found it strange. This restaurant should focus less on “aesthetics” and “pretty staff” and more on quality food & customer service.

The food is mediocre to say the least and overpriced. We got hamburger sliders and grilled shrimp tacos. The tacos looked better than they actually tasted. Definitely lacking flavor.

I was also stopped by a worker there for taking photos OF MYSELF with a light/flash although there were several other tables taking photos using a flash. I will never visit this place again. Definitely a disappointment on all levels.",1,1,1,2,"Dined on May 12, 2023"

OpenTable Diner,Cute and quiet place. Unfortunately they only serve brunch options on the weekend and have very limited options that are pricey.

Liam,Despite there not being rain or inclement weather conditions. The bar kept their rooftop closed. The only appeal to that place is the open rooftop. We had the drinks know as “the diplomat.” The drink tasted like a knock off version of kool-aid and was loaded with sugar. The busboy interacted with the table too much and had bad oral hygiene. The curly fries were marginal at best. I will say the decor entering the facility was nice.,1,1,3,1,"Dined on May 5, 2023"

While we were leaving, a lady maybe the manager told me that their renovating the rooftop and it'll look good soon! Ok then don't take no reservation or let people know at least! BUT, while we walked out I saw that there's another section that's separate from where we were seated and it had a whole carousel, thanks to my 20/20 vision. SIDE EYE.  Now I am no mathematician

If you have read about about a beautiful rooftop adorned with flowers and if you think you’ll be eating insta-worthy pink s’mores with pretty sprinkles, topped with cotton candy then to manage your expectations, they don't serve them anymore, there is no rooftop view to write home about and the only “flowers” were a couple of plastic faux trails of  ivy in an otherwise bland aesthetic. A hugely disappointing place.",1,1,1,1,"Dined on April 5, 2023"

She seemed like she had an attitude. It was my birthday and I didn’t even get a cake, meanwhile she handed a girl sitting at a table opposite me a cake. Barely came over to ask us if we were okay or needed anything else. If it weren’t for the cute decor and pictures I got, I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone who wishes to celebrate their birthday. Utter trash",1,1,1,5,"Dined on April 2, 2023"

OpenTable Diner,The service once inside was sub-par. Waitress was very inattentive and the times she did come over she was constantly looking at her watch. We didn’t even reach out hour and a half table limit because we were just turned off and the place had many empty tables so unsure why she seemed to be in a rush. It was not the “magic” experience we came to expect from this and certainly was NOT worth the $200 spent for 3 people who only had sliders and chicken fingers and two drinks. One person didn’t even drink other than the TAP water they provided.,3,3,2,2,"Dined on April 1, 2023"

Reservation was for 7:30 pm in March, it was quite cold out which I think affected the vibe we experienced because the bar was enclosed because of the weather. The enclosure hindered the view which is no one's fault. Super cute spot but the music was way too loud (think club music loud) to even hear each other at a very small table for three with incredibly uncomfortable chairs. Although our server was kind & on top of things, the food was beyond disappointing. We were aware it would be bar food but it was barely palatable. We knew the cocktails & decorations were the main attraction of the bar but we did not think the food would be treated as an afterthought. Overall, it was a huge letdown. I think if you visited in the warmer months when the bar is truly an open rooftop & only order a couple of overpriced cocktails, you might enjoy it more than we did. Definitely some cute photo opportunities for those really into socials but that is about all this place has to offer.",3,1,4,3,"Dined on March 6, 2023"

We never saw a server after that. We would have loved to order more. We actually waited another half hour or so and finally went to the bar to try to pay our bill and the bartender told us we couldn’t pay there. So we went to someone else until we were directed where we could go pay. We actually were suppose to have brunch there two days after but cancelled it because we had such a bad vibe and experience.

One of the customers from that huge party walked over to us and said “you’re not supposed to sit there we reserved this whole section”.

I did like the fact that while waiting we were able to get drinks at both bars and take pictures. Everyone who attended my brunch said that there were a lot of kids and it was quite unexpected due to it being a 21+ bar/rooftop. We feel maybe they should have one side for families/children so that way guests aren’t uncomfortable drinking in front of someone’s child.

Food was tasty and cocktails were nice. 
We checked our coats which was great but when I approached the lift I was told I wasn’t allowed my hand bag even though the security guards watched me and my husband but stuff from our coat pockets into my bag. Another women got in the lift with us with a larger bag than what I had.

At first we were placed in a back room that was empty which was nice and intimate. Until our server placed a couple on a bench directly next to us despite the fact that their were several other tables open.  We had to ask the servers several times for simple things. Utensils, water and basic service. Also when we asked for a larger plate because we ordered the stack of pancakes the waitress said “we don’t have bigger plates” and let us continue eating huge pancakes off of appetizer plates. The best service we received was at security, coat check, and the bathroom attendant “alma” yes we got her name because she was that nice. The food also lacked flavor we ordered tacos and they were very bland, the pancakes were extremely hard and the cotton candy caramelized on top to the point that we couldn’t eat it. My cousin is pregnant and wanted a mocktail or even hot chocolate. The drink menu does not service people who do not drink which is very disheartening. This is the type of place I would return to for 1 drink to take photos. Otherwise I wouldn’t return. I also work in hospitality so I know when I’m not receiving 5 star service.

When we got there we were sitting waiting for at least 10 minutes before a server came over and immediately told us we had 15 minutes to order because it was approaching 3:30 and she also told us we had until 4pm.

We started asking questions about substitutions on the menu and without asking the chef we were told no and she came back to tell us they could accommodate it.

Once our food came she rushed over to let us know that she would be cashing us out soon. The bill came soon after. We paid the bill and never saw our server again.

We had a bunch of food piled up on the table a few of my friends wanted another round of drinks but didn’t have anyone to ask.

A manager came over when my friends realized I never received the birthday dessert they asked for. He was so rude. Instead of listening to what they were saying he mentioned the donuts we ordered and paid for.

DJ was great and although the music was loud my 66 year old ears were still able to carry in and hear a conversation. The drinks were creative and delicious.

AlbertL,"Overall awesome place with an  amazing view of the Empire State building, which was lit with Christmas colors when we were there. Fun, upbeat atmosphere, beautifully decorated and an amazing carousel with 4 cozy seats perfect for a quick picture when not being used as a reserved table. The menu was limited and the food was just ok, definitely overpriced but you've gotta eat to sit on the carousel side. Drinks were good and you are limited to 90 min. once seated.  Would definitely recommend because it's such a cool place with a speakeasy vibe getting up to the top. We loved it",5,3,5,5,"Dined on December 28, 2022"

I don’t normally leave reviews but this was the biggest waste of time, the food would have been better at McDonald’s.
While trying to eat and enjoy my drink, all I could smell was a dirty bin smell wafting past. The smell came from all the rubbish behind the bar right next to us.
The staff matched the rest of this place, I would highly recommend to avoid this experience especially if you don’t have time to waste. I saw other mixed reviews and gave them the benefit of the doubt, big mistake!",1,1,1,1,"Dined on December 27, 2022"

OpenTable Diner,"Turned up and was told our reservation for two was going to be 20 minutes late and did we want to sit on the carousel. We said sure and was told to check in upstairs. There was no one at the desk upstairs and no one to greet or assist us so we sat down on the carousel. Within a couple of minutes, we decided that the carousel wouldn’t be appropriate for drinks and food and tried to get the attention of a staff member to ask to move. No one bothered even giving us eye contact. We saw a couple of tables that were free so we sat down at one table for 2, still hoping to catch the attention of someone. Was ignored for a whole 20 minutes until a very rude staff member came and starting saying we needed a reservation to be there. She talked over me and refused to listen to the fact that I did indeed have a reservation and was barking at me the fact that I’d be charged for sitting at the table I was at. She went and got what appeared to be the manager who was even more rude (which I didn’t think was possible) who was yelling saying that I should’ve come to see her to check in for my table. I tried to explain that there was no one at the desk and that I hadn’t even seen her for 20 minutes but this was something that she clearly couldn’t understand. We finally established that I did in fact have a reservation and I could stay put on the 2 person table that we’d sat down. We decided to leave due to the appalling customer service. A shame as we had booked this months ago and this was our first night in New York after arriving from New Zealand after a gruelling 20 odd hour journey. Wouldn’t recommend.",1,1,1,3,"Dined on December 22, 2022"

We ordered the s'mores (it was 3 of us) for $21 which came with 2 s'mores to make, which is fine, but our waiter should have at least asked us if we wanted an extra graham cracker and marshmallow for the 3rd person? We eventually did ask and it was another $8. Whatever, just pretty offensively priced for a MARSHMALLOW and graham cracker, which btw were neither pink nor frosted as advertised on the menu.

On top of that, I only chose this place based on things they were advertising like their s’mores dessert plate & their donuts, didn’t have either of those. Asked for the hot chocolate w tequila, they lazily have it already batched w vodka. Asked for some fun creative drink then instead w tequila & I got a basic red drink that tasted only like the pomegranate mixer they put in it. Plus, I know it was cold out but at least someee type of airflow. I was under the impression this was a partially open rooftop & they just had plastic shades all over the place obstructing what’s supposed to be part of a rooftop venue experience, the view.

traveler,"Magic hour is unique. It reminds me of a bar with some small plates. For the people complaining about portions this isn’t a steak house. This place is intended for drunks and small plates and has desserts. It’s supposed to be fun and photogenic. Go on their instagram to get the idea. The drinks were strong and looked pretty,  they have a couple different spots for photo opps which are pretty. It’s not a huge place but a beautiful view. We had the spicy chicken sandwich which was  great and the brunch breakfast. The only complaint If I had one was that the donuts were dull. I was expecting a better presentation",5,5,5,5,"Dined on December 4, 2022"

The hostess asked them to move (which they did), but encouraged us to sit down without wiping the table down, and when we asked someone to do so we received an attitude. Sorry, I’m not sitting at a dirty table. Not only was the service terrible, the staff was blatantly racist and unconcerned. We were told from others that the service was terrible and racism was obvious but wanted to give the place a chance. We were placed in a corner and disregarded the entire time. I would never recommend for anyone to consider this place. After 30 minutes of being ignored, we decided to leave. Imagine going to a place for a celebration just for the staff to ruin everything? Unacceptable and unbelievable. This place is more concerned about appearance than the actual service to customers - especially those that are native to NYC and not tourists.",1,1,1,5,"Dined on December 3, 2022"

I got the momager and 10/10 I recommend this drink. I wish I could have took the stiletto shoe glass with me! The waitress seemed like she was in a rush and wanted us to get out of there. We had just finished my salad and she came and shoved the check at our table…at that point I was over it and we paid and left.

service was not very attentive
waiter brought us our champagne & appetizer shortly after being seated and returned to us about 40 minutes later . By then our drinks were past due to have a beverage with my sandwich .
brought it to her attention when she finally approached our table that i was already highly unsatisfied with my service and the performance of a server should be much better than that, she giggles & apologizes to then walk away and still not ask for my order . Shortly after I’m given a different server which wasn’t much better than the first . Lack of training is what seems like . The decor & view of the Empire State Building was the highlight to my night
Other than that the place is highly overrated

The food was horrible - over cooked & dehydrated !!  …and all the decorations were off the rotating carousel & adjacent walls… this place is more about the ambience than the food and if you take the ambience away and still give horrible food it’s a no-win both ways!  The managers could care less about accommodating any of our request for seating.  Tried to put 13 of us at a table for eight - Despite our reservation booked well  in advance AND a phone call AND email sent to the venue to confirm.

I enjoyed my food(shrimp tacos), however some of my friends were not pleased with the taste of their food and that it was overpriced ($18 for chicken fingers). We were a group of 8, our waiter was really nice, food came quick. We went on a Sat so at 2.5 hrs they were ready to get us out of there, which was expected on busy night, Mgr came over and was polite about it lol.

DoraL,The only positive thing I can say is that the flower stairs and the carousel makes the whole restaurant. Food was absolutely tasteless and bland even the chicken fingers served with 2 weird sauces that wasn’t good. Also they were overpriced for something that wasn’t even made in the store. Chik fil a chicken tenders is a million times better and reasonably priced. The service was terrible and wasn’t check on after we got our drinks nevermind the food came out before the drinks. It’s just a terrible experience. The ambiance is cool but the music is better. Would not recommend this place.,2,1,1,3,"Dined on October 23, 2022"

I've worked in the service industry and I understand the staff can be swamped on a Friday night, but I've been here during happy hour when there were even more people, and the bartenders were on top of it and friendly.

This is a place where they sell the image and their instagramability. So they should let people know if their main area is closed in advance by email.

We were also sat on a table that was wobbly and it took a waiter 10 minutes to notice and fix it. Only after our drinks were almost spilled.

I chose this date because I would like to go to the place before winter and the intense cold… I also had a chance to go on a Tuesday or Wednesday, days that usually tend to be more empty.",1,1,1,1,"Dined on October 19, 2022"

We got water delivered right away...then we sat for 20 minutes without a soul speaking to us.  We thought we had to go up to the bar to get our drinks, but guests next to us said no - there is service, but it's just slow.  We flagged down our Busser and we told him what we wanted to drink, and he said he would bring it.  Around 8:30 we were greeted by our waitress.  She asked, ""Is everything OK?""  we said, the water is fine, but we haven't gotten anything else yet.  Then the Busser delivered the drinks.  We asked the waitress for the check as there was no way if drinks took 30 minutes, we could attempt to order food.  We had a show we needed to be at by 9:30.  Still no check....until we chatted with the Busser again.  The Busser was FABULOUS!  And very helpful.  I truly hope he got the tip and didn't have to share it with the waitress. I am sure this was just a fluke and I know everyone is understaffed.  The drinks were delicious....and the spot very beautiful and dj spun great sounds.",1,3,2,4,"Dined on October 17, 2022"

The waitress had good recommendations for our dinner, however, she wasn’t very friendly.

My friend and I arrived and were sat. The server, who also appeared to be working the bar, came over and made sure we got water. We then didn't have our order taken for close to thirty minutes. We had to ask multiple times for someone to come check on us. We got our cocktails about fifteen minutes later. The food did not show up for another hour. The server/bartender was actually very nice and I felt bad for her. She was clearly left on her own to work that entire area of the bar/lounge. She definitely needed more assistance, but there multiple people walking around who seemed to be doing nothing at all. We couldn't tell if they were meant to be security, managers, etc?  Either way, they weren't needed, but the server definitely needed back-up and should have been provided with it. We should have had the bill waived at the end of the night due to the service and delay, but instead, we were just given shots, which we did not ask for.

OpenTable Diner,"I booked this place for my friend’s birthday. I had a reservation set but when we arrived our table was not ready. It was ok because the wait wasn’t too bad but once it was ready, they did not give us enough seats to fit everybody at the moment. Once we got that together, we all were shocked that the brunch was not bottomless but when we read online, it said it was. ( Which is why I booked here in the first place.) We couldn’t decide what we wanted to eat because the options were minimal. Once we finally ordered, our food took forever to come. Our waitress barely checked on us to make sure we were ok. And it was also bad for her because we were a group of 12 and she was working by herself with several other tables in our section. The food was ok but the amount they are charging for a basic brunch was outrageous to me. The mimosas were not that great so I’m not sure what type of champagne it was but it had to do for the moment. The music gets a 3/10. It was not versatile enough. The ambience oh the whole place was an 8/10. The aesthetic was very pleasing to look at. The rooftop area was very nice and pleasing to the eye. The area where you can take pictures around the flowers and steps made for great photos. Also on the other side of the the restaurant, it had a carousel that was pink and white with pretty flowers around it as well. All great for taking pictures and the carousel actually did go around as you were on it. That was our favorite part of the whole place. My personal opinion would be for aesthetics, 10/10 but anything else… 3/10.",3,3,2,5,"Dined on September 17, 2022"

OpenTable Diner,"Entering is exciting and staff at the entrance are very nice. We had a reservation so we were seated immediately.  Music is great. We waited for 35 mins before the waitress came to our table, an hour before we got our drinks, with one order being wrong.  After and hour and 20 minutes, we ask our waitress where our food is, and she realizes she never put our order in. She may have realized sooner if she actually checked on us, but never did. It is also advertised as an open roof top location with large installations to pose with and photo ops. It is not open, it is closed and and only has the bedazzled merry go round. We cancelled the order and left immediately. Great ambiance, place has a lot of potential and they need better wait staff.",1,1,1,4,"Dined on September 17, 2022"

There was something on my glass and she kept saying that’s the glass I had to literally scratch the glass to tell her it’s something brown inside the glass.

So much security just to have brunch with my 16-year-old daughter they even made her throw out a water bottle that was in her small backpack (we’re touring the city and had water). The food was awful. I got a chicken sandwich that had so much sauce on it the bread was soggy and falling apart. My daughter got a  salad and steak which also was drenched  in dressing even the steak had dressing. The small tables over big chairs force you to lean hunched over just to eat.

TeeBee,"Came here to celebrate two birthdays. It was a cute set up. A little smaller than I thought and one side (side with pink animals) was cuter than the Elephant Room side. We waited 30 min to order and then 30 for the food.  The order was wrong and they had to redo it. On the plus it was back in about 20 min instead of 30. Had the grilled salmon Caesar salad and it was delish!!! Way better than I thought. Drinks definitely gave you a buzz however we were with someone who doesn’t eat sugar and 99.9% of the drinks had syrup, liqueur or some other sweetener so there were few options for them. Service could be better. Waitress didn’t check on us often, we had to beg for water, our waitress’ shift ended in the middle of our meal so we had like a total of 3 different waitresses. There was also an issue with the machines so my debit card was held and run back and forth more often than necessary so I didn’t like that. Everything that requires service was slow including drinks. Our reservation was 5 and it wasn’t very crowded so I don’t understand the delay. I will be honest they didn’t enforce a 90 min time limit with us. We left after 8pm! So we were there 3 hours and we definitely didn’t feel rushed. I was concerned about that being that their service was slow but I didn’t need to be. As we were leaving at 8ish that is when the crowd started to arrive so there began to be waits to take pics at the various areas (ie carousel and pink animals). Overall it was cute. Some things were awesome (food and ambiance) some things need work (service and communication). Ranking 3 stars but would go back again.",3,4,2,5,"Dined on August 28, 2022"

Being enclosed, yes-you are on a rooftop, there is ZERO air circulation. Least a few fans would do them some good. The waitress didn’t come to us for over 30 minutes once we were sat down and we had to ask the runner for water several times throughout the meal. The menu is set up for brunch in “courses” first, second etc. however, you receive ALL the food together which would have been nice for them to tell you upon ordering. It was overwhelming having all the food delivered at once. The atmosphere was beautiful, but it didn’t make up for how ridiculously hot and stuffy it was.

Food4Thought,"Went for 25th birthday celebration. Booked a month before arrival and needed wheelchair assessibility seating. The two doormen were pleasant and friendly as they escorted our party of five to the elevator.  Elevator escort was also pleasant.  Once on floor of Magic Hour the hostess was not inviting and had rude attutide. She walked us to our table which resembled a small low coffee table with chairs and a low couch which didn't make any sense to me; she left and then we waited and waited for our waitress. I had to get up and take our cake to the hostess and practically insist on having the the bday caketo refrigerated becaue the waitress 20 minutes to come to our coffee table. The waitress was not attentive -worse service.  Little plates and drinks just okay. Music was okay but extremely loud. Nice decor for photos. Carousel was reserved so you could sit on it, Reserved for who because no one arrived the whole time we were there. Not worth the hassel....",2,1,1,3,"Dined on August 27, 2022"

Olly,"Service was terrible. That wasn't my first time in Magic Hour but I've not ever experienced such a service before. After placing an order for drinks and receiving them it took our waitress over 45 min to show up to take our food order. Even though we told her upon placing a drink order that we are about ready to order food. We were on the verge of finishing the drink and walking out. Finally after getting food we haven't been checked on even once. She only showed up to bring us a check. 
Also the bag check-in is ridiculous. This is not the airport, you know. There was a huge line to check in the bags, and even though I had a tiny shopping bag I was kicked out of the elevator to check it in. The personnel at the coat check was rude, and overall it was a humiliating experience.

There was literally zero breeze and they had the roof 80% closed (it was a sunny 80 degree day, no clouds). They need to install some fans ASAP. We had to ask for water three times, which given how hot it was you would have thought the waitress would have came to the table with it, and when we finally got the still water it tasted like dirty glassware. 

We were going to eat but we were SO uncomfortable we left after having one round of drinks. Such a shame because I was there the night Moxy opened and wanted to bring an out-of-town friend. Will probably never go back after this experience.",2,2,2,1,"Dined on August 26, 2022"

Told the waitress and the manager that it was my daughter‘s birthday and I would like a sparkler in a cupcake after we ate. After waiting 10 more minutes after we were done eating I told the waitress we were done with our food, never asked if we wanted dessert and never bought the cupcake with a sparkler in for my daughters birthday, just bought the check.

The view was amazing, food was great (should have come with some sort of side for $20, but the shrimp tacos were phenomenal), carousel and decor were awesome. However, the music was so loud it felt more like a club and everyone around us seemed to be staring at their phones instead of talking to the people they were sitting with because no one could hear, yet there was no dance floor to be seen.

CarolynR,"First the website says for the brunch reservations is ""recommended"". It also says all ages 11:30-3pm. Nowhere does it say that if you do not have a reservation you cannot enter with child as you would have to sit at bar and child not allowed. So turned up after driving hour and half to be told I cannot enter for brunch with my 19 year old. Now prior to going I had tried to get the ""recommended"" reservations but no open spots. Realizing my dilemma the security (brightest part of my visit...he was so gracious and helpful) advised me to try again for a reservation which now was suddenly available. Only now I had to almost 2 hours wait. If not for my daughter obsession with pink I would've left.  so again my friendly security suggested I go next door and relax until my time. 

My time comes and now I'm told they only have seats on the carousal...at this point its whatever. Now for the meal. First I literally had to send twice for someone to pay attention. Ordered and waited a bit. The salad was horrible...lettuce bitter and old. Everything else was just ok. Had to remind them of my cotton candy order when I was asking for my bill. Attention was just lacking.

Otherwise the ambiance was not what it looks like on the internet .. actually heard that comment made be a couple persons. I guess props are seasonal...flowers needed more pink and I'm guessing the lighting shows up better at nights.

All in all very disappointed. Did not meet my expectations. Shout out to the security...he was the best",1,3,2,2,"Dined on July 24, 2022"

ZahavaS,It was a party of 7 celebrating my daughters bday/graduation on Sunday July 24th at noontime. It was a 95 degree day. The rooftop magic hour was extremely hot and uncomfortable. The AC was not enough to cool the room and they had NO FANS whatsoever for air circulation. We could not sit still or eat and many times left to take a walk indoors to get some AC relief. It was disruptive. The food came out before our drinks. We would have liked to have our cocktails first.  We waited 20-30 mins to get our drinks after food arrived. Not acceptable. It’s a pretty place but highly overrated.,3,4,4,3,"Dined on July 24, 2022"
FrancesS,Food and service were great. A bit overpriced but I get it …paying for the flower decor which was really pretty. It was just sooo hot.

AmyG,"It’s summer and it’s unusually hot so fans or other cooling features would help and be a nice addition. Ambience and photo ops were cute and fun. We had exceptional service once we entered the restaurant. We enjoyed Sunday brunch (first seating at 11:30) and indulged in the Pink AF pancakes with pink cotton candy. We also enjoyed the frittata with egg whites, Mushrooms and spinach. Generous portion. Mimosa? Yes please!!! Bathroom attendant was a very special touch. She had everything one may need to freshen up. You have to check large bags prior to going up to the restaurant-which was fine-but it was very confusing how to retrieve them upon departure. We had to ask several staff members how to find the checked bags which were behind a black curtained off area and then around and down a hallway. Down the rabbit hole! Not in a fun way. That could be a fun feature instead of a confusing mess. That and check-in could be improved upon. Check in attendants weren’t very welcoming and seemed rather irritated that we did not know where to stand. There was no signage and they expected all of us to stand on the grates on the outside of the sidewalk (most guests were wearing spiked heels so this was impossible for them). All in we were happy we had this experience.",5,5,5,5,"Dined on July 24, 2022"

OpenTable Diner,The carousel requires a reservation (max 2 people) although no one gave us any trouble when we took pictures at an empty table. If you go when the suns out just know there are NO fans on the rooftop. We went at 6:00 and stayed for one drink due to the heat. Although when we explored the left side of the rooftop (by the flower steps) it was a lot cooler. The sun had gone down a bit but I think it was because the doors were open to an air conditioned inside bar so you would catch a breeze there. My recommendation would be to ask to sit on that side and get up to take pictures on the other side if you would like a photo op AND the cute drinks. I would go ag,4,2,2,4,"Dined on July 24, 2022"
pineapplemangocherry1234,"Aesthetically pleasing. Food was ok. We ordered fries, chips and dips and shrimp tacos. It’s a nice place to take pictures, have appetizers and drinks. If you want a full course meal, I wouldn’t suggest it. But overall, Great service across all staff (i.e., elevator staff, bathroom staff, server). One of the staff came to our table a few times to make sure we were comfortable and all our needs were met. I don’t know his name but I think he introduced himself as the manager. It was a little hard to hear. But he was pleasant. I also liked that we didn’t feel rushed to leave our table. I would go back again.",5,3,5,5,"Dined on July 24, 2022"

Pictures came out great the food was OK More of quick bites than a full menu the drinks were excellent we really enjoyed the indoor bar our server was a bit slow didn’t come to our table that much but I think it’s because she was handling all the tables in the outdoor section we were sitting at?

Mecho,"The place is beautiful obviously is a roof top in NYC. Reason for my poor rating is as follow, I am understand is the summer however AC or even fan needs to be available for guess and employees.   My sister almost faint because of how hot was during brunch.  When I ask the the hostess, her answer was “is a rooftop” what can you expect.  I work for customer services and a better answer need to be available.  Their employees were dying because of the heat, they were great however it is unethical to have them work under those conditions.  Food was great, location perfect. However is the summer, it was hot. They need to have at least a fan or AC since the rooftop was cover available for their client.ma.  Hostess need to be retrained.

OpenTable Diner,"This was a HORRIBLE experience. It was extremely overpriced, hot and humid, and very slow service. I made a reservation for my birthday but i wish I hadn’t. They made things 10xs more complicated than it needed to be. The waitress was terrible, so slow and basically absent. She clearly did not want to serve us but was so attentive to the groups around us. Then she out loud called me the B word to a bunch of her coworkers at the bar and in front of guest. Why would she do that you ask? Because after 30 minutes of waiting and not checking on my table i went up to her at the bar and asked for the check. Very kindly, after she had Ignored my table all night on my birthday, might i add. Then when i turned away to walk back is when she said it. And My whole party say her do it. We were shocked. I have never had that experience or heard of that happening in my life and i have worked in service for years. It’s so unbelievable, unprofessional and unacceptable. I went to tell the manager what happened and she was awful to deal with and not helpful in the least. She would not even apologize and said to me, “well I wasn’t there so I can’t apologize for her. I’ve never had this happen before so how should i handle it? I don’t know what to do. I didn’t hear what she said so I just can’t apologize for her. Should I get you some water?” This manager handled it so horribly, was absolutely useless and unhelpful on my birthday. I clearly didn’t matter to them as a customer or even as a human being. I will never return and none of my guests will either. Disgusting and unprofessional people work here.",1,1,1,3,"Dined on July 19, 2022"

When we brought this to her attention, she didn’t apologize but merely replaced the glasses. The food is “cafeteria” food at best - dry chicken tenders and plain sliders. The fries were tasty.

Staff didn’t seem like they wanted to be there, with the exception of the man who walked us to the elevator on the way out who was friendly and chatty. Our server was quite frankly miserable and forgot about us the majority of the time - had to ask multiple times for water, once food was brought to table she didn’t come back to check on us or see if we wanted to order more drinks etc. 
the food itself wasn’t great…the Cesar salad wasn’t great, and definitely wasn’t Cesar dressing. Fries were decent but not hot, the pink AF pancakes were nice but most definitely not worth the $45 for minimal toppings. 
It is also a rooftop with zero air conditioning or fans - not the most comfortable of experiences on a 90 degree day.

The to other people that had reservations were seated on the carousel side. The drinks were served in dirty plastic glasses. When we left the same hostess/floor manager did not lift her head up to say thank you or bye. Avoid at all costs! Tourist trap! And I would suggest you offer customer service to the lady seating people yesterday. I am a business owner myself and I would be disgusted if any of my customers were made to feel this way.

There are sooooo many rules: I had a bottle of wine wrapped as a gift for a friend. I could not bring it with me. As soon as we checked in, they told us we had the table for 1 hour 45 minutes only. I had a plastic bottle of water that I could not bring with me, so they asked me to throw it away or drink it all. 
After 1 hour 45 minutes, I asked the server if we were allowed to stay and the answer was ""yes, as long as you keep drinking."" That's not an answer that I really appreciated.

But I don't need a list of rules when I'm trying to just eat food and have a drink.  We had to check our bags. Mandatory. WHY! I'm going to a table that I have reservations for.  Then they demanded 2 hour limit. WHY! No one was really interested in our table after we left.  Well... Honestly that's the price you pay for hanging in Midtown.

MoniqueM,"I’m sure as many others, I learned about the Magic Rooftop thru social media. They have a fun, inviting presence that makes you want to see it for yourself. I hosted a meet up with some ladies (total 4 of us) to have an early dinner at the Magic Rooftop. Upon arrival, I noticed the space is a lot smaller than I had anticipated given the pics, but it is still beautiful and fun. Food isn’t amazing but it is tasty. I had the chicken sandwich. It didn’t seem as high end as I expected given the Tao brand but it was fresh, hot, and pretty good as far as taste. I opted for the low battery drink which was delicious. My only issue here is that the dining staff are rude. The hostess, door man, and everyone else were great. But we had rude dining staff that came to our table, dropped the check (literally) then walked away. They never asked if we wanted anything else or if we were OK, just dropped the check on the table and walked away. We actually had wanted to purchase more drinks but that went out the window when they did that. In addition, one of the staff members walked to our table, as we were talking, interjected himself in between the two of us, to look at the signed receipt copy. No apology, just randomly grabbing the receipt to see if my friend had signed it. Another instance, was me asking about getting my reward points and the waitress rolling her eyes after I asked 3 times and she promised she would get me an answer, only to give me the wrong answer. The cake topper however, was my group and I in mid conversation, and a staff member walked over and put a reservation sign on the table and began to clean the table, as if we weren’t there. I understand there is a 90 minute dining time but we never received a warning that our time was up or even approaching. This had to be among the worst dining service I can recall. I highly doubt I’ll return in the future but thanks for the experience.",2,4,2,3,"Dined on June 20, 2022"

The servers were kind (once they finally came to our table) though clearly a bit stressed and overworked. The snacks and drinks are good but obviously very overpriced for what they are.

But only took our request for water at about 3:15  and didn’t come back to the table till 20mins later to then say brunch was over and we would have to wait till 4 to then be only able to order from the “dinner menu” that consisted of about 10 items. Fries, salads, tacos, sliders, chicken tenders. I was devastated!!! Originally I wanted steak but All I wanted in the end was eggs and bacon thinking that is the easiest request. But to no avail I got nothing. I was promised at least bacon on my sliders which later was denied. Waitress offered us complimentary desserts and drinks. Which got me excited since it was my birthday… We got nothing. Music was also poor and not diverse at all. Nonetheless Food did taste good however we were starving by the time we got it and I would’ve eaten anything by that point. Place is decent for a celebration due to the beautiful Aesthetics.

About 30 mins later, we still didn’t have our food or drinks another table became available and we asked to switch and they refused. We ended up calling over the manager Julian which was very rude and he said he would see what he could do about it. He never came back to our table. We ended up leaving without even ordering food because of how uncomfortable and rude the entire experience was. As we were leaving 7 other tables were available I approached the manager julian and asked him why he never returned to our table to assist us as he said he would. He just continued to be rude.

Just a little disappointed, I hope next time I will have a better service.",3,3,3,5,"Dined on May 31, 2022"
SamanthaH,"We made a reservation days in advance for a friends birthday. Once we arrived, they seated us immediately but we did not get helped for atleast 20 minutes. Once we did get a server, we ordered one drink and then she never came back until I had to track her down. We ordered our food and it arrived timely and was overall good but she never came to check on us or to see if we needed anything else which we did. I ended up flagging down a different server to help me. There were only two of us and they would not split the check for us, so we paid together. Once she gave us the check, we noticed that we had been charged for there drinks when we had only 2. I could not find our server to help correct this so I had to flag down yet again another server to help get it corrected. Overall the price is too high for the crappy service. Go there if hire only looking for your Instagram photo and a $100 bill for 2 drinks and 2 entrees.",2,2,1,3,"Dined on May 31, 2022"

Didn’t get A server to come to us for over 15 mins and they only give you 90 mins at a table that’s what was pretty annoying especially since it wasn’t even busy. I had to call someone I saw that worked there from the bar who proceeded to ask me “do you have a reservation?” Which I replied yes and I’ve been sitting here for 15 mins. Their cocktails are subpar tbh the look pretty but taste meh. Just order a bottle of wine or champagne for your table honestly.

Judy,"This was such a disappointment, i came here to celebrate my birthday with friends but this place is only if you want to take pictures and that’s it. My friend who is pregnant got a Cesar salad and my other friend got fries and lemonade to start. My friend didn’t eat her salad its was very dry and so was the fries. The lemonade tasted weird. When the waitress came we told her our order which included mimosas. 20 minutes later, still nothing. Not even the drinks. We had a 2pm reservation and it wasn’t crowded so I didn’t understand why everything was taking  long.  The only thing she was quick on was giving us a small Avian water bottle that was warm as hell when it was 80 degrees outside and it was more frustrating when we got the check and the 4 water bottles cost $20. Its not about the price, at least provide a cup with ice. The most frustrating part is when the waitress came back to check on us , i was wondering where was the rest of our order, our drinks and food???? I asked for the check so quick . We weren’t going to wait another 20-30 if I told her about the food because it seemed like she didn’t take down our order. I didn’t want to make a scene and argue. So we left. So 4 water bottles, 2 lemonades, one fries, and a Cesar salad — check was $54 for 4 people.",1,1,1,3,"Dined on May 22, 2022"

I paid $16 for a mediocre vodka lemonade and left before dying of heatstroke because it Is a rooftop bar with zero fans. Don’t believe the hype.

First off we get upstairs there is absolutely nobody at the host stand so I walk inside and they tell me I have to speak to a host to get seated which obviously i knew but clearly there was nobody there. I go back wait for someone to finally show up just so I can get seated at a dirty corner. My waitress was super sweet but extremely slow! I ordered two martinis one with grey goose one with Tito’s & she came to the table spilling the drinks and literally as she’s passing them she’s holding the glass by the rim so now I have to put my mouth all around a glass that had your fingers all over it. I had to ask for water I was not given water as soon as I sat I literally got my appetizers and my drinks with no water no napkins and no silverware I had to ask for everything! And the fact that my original waitress said goodnight because she had to go home the second girl was a nightmare. Not attentive at all gave me attitude because I told her I’ve been waiting a long time trying to get her attention and she snapped at me saying she has other things to do mind you I was watching her the whole time doing nothing just to see if she’d at least look over to me. I wanted to buy a bottle of wine so I ask to get a taste of the pino noir then I asked her which one she poured me from the list points at a random pino then comes back and tells me she doesn’t have any of those on the list that she actually poured me a different pino noir. Listen this is an absolute nightmare! People literally come here dressed like they’re going to bed, straight up homeless looking people just roaming around getting drunk. Such a beautiful place it shouldn’t have to be this much of a mess I’m super disappointed. People go crazy about this place! I would never come here not even to sit at the bar.
